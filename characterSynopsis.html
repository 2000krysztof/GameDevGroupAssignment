                Like his Father, Igor joined the KGB
                 straight out of university. His analytical mind and adaptability quickly caught the attention of his superiors. With each successful mission,
                  Igor's reputation grew within the KGB. Recently, Igor's exemplary service in Moscow earned him a promotion to a crucial position within the agency. 
                <br>
                Igor is a reserved and pragmatic individual, who is highly patriotic for his country. He approaches his work with meticulous attention to detail,
                 always considering the broader implications of his actions. While he may not stand out in a crowd, Igor uses this to his advantage and his unassuming demeanor hides a sharp intellect and a tenacious spirit.
                 Igor is known for his ability to stay calm under pressure,making him an invaluable asset in high-stakes situations.

                 integration into various environments. Standing at 5'10", with short black hair and a well-maintained physique reflecting KGB discipline, his facial features include a strong jawline and straight nose. He maintains a clean-shaven, professional countenance. Igor's attire consists of a dark green suit with red accents on the shoulders and neck, paired with dark green pants. He completes the look with a dark green cap featuring red near the brim, which is black. 
                <br>
                Igor Volkov, a versatile KGB agent, excels in linguistics, disguise, hand-to-hand combat, and firearms. His analytical acumen,
                 strategic planning, and expertise in information extraction make him a vital asset for Soviet national security. His weaknesses are that he has trust issues, and his patriotism begins to falter under pressure.
