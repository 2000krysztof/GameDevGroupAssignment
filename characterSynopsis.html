                    Name: Igor Volkov
                    <br>
                    Igor Volkov, codename “Kapuznik” is a
                    thirty-five-year-old KGB Agent who was born and raised in Moscow, surrounded by the rich history and
                    culture of the Soviet Union. From a young age, he displayed exceptional intelligence and a keen
                    interest in his surroundings.
                    His father, a KGB agent, instilled in him a strong sense of patriotism and duty to the state.
                    <br>
                    Like his Father, Igor joined the KGB
                    straight out of university. His analytical mind and adaptability quickly caught the attention of his
                    superiors. With each successful mission,
                    Igor's reputation grew within the KGB. Recently, Igor's exemplary service in Moscow earned him a
                    promotion to a crucial position within the agency.
                    <br>
                    Igor is a reserved and pragmatic individual, who is highly patriotic for his country. He approaches
                    his work with meticulous attention to detail,
                    always considering the broader implications of his actions. While he may not stand out in a crowd,
                    Igor uses this to his advantage and his unassuming demeanor hides a sharp intellect and a tenacious
                    spirit.
                    Igor is known for his ability to stay calm under pressure,making him an invaluable asset in
                    high-stakes situations.

                    <br>
                    Igor Volkov has a subtly commanding appearance designed for seamless
                    integration into various environments. Standing at 5'10", with short black hair and a
                    well-maintained physique reflecting KGB discipline, his facial features include a strong jawline and
                    straight nose. He maintains a clean-shaven, professional countenance. Igor's attire consists of a
                    dark green suit with red accents on the shoulders and neck, paired with dark green pants. He
                    completes the look with a dark green cap featuring red near the brim, which is black.
                    <br>
                    Igor Volkov, a versatile KGB agent, excels in linguistics, disguise, hand-to-hand combat, and
                    firearms. His analytical acumen,
                    strategic planning, and expertise in information extraction make him a vital asset for Soviet
                    national security. His weaknesses are that he has trust issues, and his patriotism begins to falter
                    under pressure.
                    <br>
                    Name: Pierre Dubois
                    Pierre Dubois, codename “Le Fantôme” is an elite spy from France, tasked with crumbling the Soviet
                    Union from inside by leading multiple spy networks, using them to cause dissent and chaos across the
                    USSR. He is the main antagonist of “Behind the Iron Curtain”.

                    <br>


                    As multiple plots to sow revolution across the USSR are thwarted by Igor, Pierre realizes who foiled
                    his schemes and begins to see Igor as a rival. He eventually takes matters into his own hands and
                    plans to assassinate the dictator of the USSR, Stalin II, aiming to eliminate Igor as part of his
                    plan.
                    <br>



                    Pierre is forty years old, tall, and athletically built, with a chiseled face and a strong jawline.
                    His movements are graceful, and he carries himself with a confident stride. His well-groomed, dark
                    hair has a slight tousle, alongside a well-groomed handlebar mustache.
                    <br>



                    Pierre Dubois is always impeccably dressed. He wears a gray tailored suit and black gloves, and
                    carries all manner of gadgets which vary based on his current mission, and always has a smoke bomb
                    and a silenced pistol concealed on his person. He also has a microphone for giving orders to spies,
                    cleverly disguised as a rose on his suit.
                    <br>



                    Cool under pressure, Pierre Dubois carries an air of quiet confidence. With a refined taste in art,
                    literature, and fine dining, Pierre embodies sophistication. He is incredibly charismatic and
                    captivating. As an over-the-top elite spy, he acts in a very cryptic and mysterious manner.
                    <br>



                    He is also full of himself and cannot accept that anyone could be better than him. He is motivated
                    partially by wanting to serve his country but is mainly drawn to espionage due to the money, thrill
                    and status of being an elite super-spy.
                    <br>



                    Pierre is extremely intelligent, capable of adapting to many situations, and speaks many different
                    languages, blending in seamlessly at formal occasions. True to his codename, he is also a master at
                    escaping unnoticed from dangerous areas. He is extremely tech-savvy, seemingly having a gadget
                    prepared for every scenario. However, he tends to over-rely on his gadgets, which could leave him
                    vulnerable if he is caught unprepared without his precious devices to help him.
